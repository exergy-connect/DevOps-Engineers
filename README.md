## Congratulations to Marijn van Rooij! üéâ
[Marijn van Rooij](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marijn-van-rooij-7358579a/) - CTO and co-founder of Dutch energy startup [Ocean Grazer](https://oceangrazer.com/) - just [won](https://indiaeducationdiary.in/university-of-groningen-alumnus-marijn-van-rooij-wins-prince-friso-engineering-award-2022/) the Dutch Prince Friso Engineering Award 2022, a price given once a year to a promising and exceptional engineer by the Dutch organization of engineers ([KIVI](https://www.kivi.nl/)).

The jury was impressed by his technological contributions and vision, and welcomed his promise to promote and encourage his behavior for the benefit of society at large.

Consider [this story on Organizational Mechanics](https://www.squawkpoint.com/2016/07/trail-and-error/): After various trials and errors (449 iterations to be exact), people were able to improve the performance of a soap nozzle exponentially.

## How thinking about a child affects its success
[This article](https://www.squawkpoint.com/2014/04/below-standard-performance-rating/) explains the science behind the common sense: If you think positively, you are more likely to see a positive outcome (in a virtuous spiral)

## An engineer's perspective on Ocean Grazer
In ["What to think of that award-winning Dutch Ocean Battery?"](https://www.wattisduurzaam.nl/38139/energie-opslaan/reservoirs/what-to-think-of-that-award-winning-dutch-ocean-battery/) Thijs ten Brink shares his opinion. His conclusion neatly summarizes the article: "All in all, I find it hard to grasp that Ocean Grazer has been selected to represent the Netherlands at CES2022, hard to grasp that the jury at this event was impressed by the startup and hard to grasp that the national and international press is so wildly enthusiastic about this concept"

## A call for action and collaboration
Having considered all of the above, I think one thing is abundantly clear: Marijn could use our help.

‚úÖ We all need solutions that solve variability of green energy availability to better match supply with demand<br>
‚úÖ Ocean Grazer has presented a concrete step in that direction (soap nozzle prototype #1)<br>
‚úÖ There are many ways in which these concepts could be improved<br>

You are invited to use the tooling in front of you - i.e. GitHub - to contribute to this cause. Submit PRs to add references or reasons to change something, create issues to discuss certain points about the project that you are concerned about, or have solutions for.

Let's collaborate to improve the Ocean Grazer energy storage concept by 100x (or any factor you like)
