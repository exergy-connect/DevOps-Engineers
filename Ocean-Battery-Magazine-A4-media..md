# OCEAN BATTERY: The Solution for the Global Energy Storage problem
## Powered by Eco-friendly Underwater Energy Storage

Soon, weather conditions will dictate the timing of renewable energy production, causing large fluctuations.
Oversupply, resulting in negative energy prices and eventually blackouts, will create a huge market for large
scale energy storage. The Ocean Battery is an offshore energy storage system that can be deployed at the source of power generation.
Managing the flow of electricity through the power grid and balancing supply and demand.
Who wants to sell at Negative Energy Prices?

## Balancing Supply and Demand
Large scale energy storage transforms wind, solar and tidal energy will be transformed into dispatchable power
plants with the Ocean Battery. This allows to generate power when we need it. The ultimate solution to prevent
oversupply and hence negative energy prices. Curtailment will no longer be needed. Our solution can significantly
improve the profitability of your renewable energy project. An exponentially growing market in excess of 200 B$.

# Black start Power
By the year 2050 the offshore power generation will exceed 1200 GW. This equals 25% of
the global power generation capacity today! It means we will build offshore a completely
new power grid. This power grid will however be unlike anything we have built before. It
only connects generators with hardly any demand at all and these generators will all peak
simultaneously during storms. Excess generation will overload the grid resulting grid
instabilities and blackouts. Our solution can prevent peak loads and provide the crucial
black start power in case the unfortunate thing happened. How do you plan to deal with
this challenge in the transition towards a sustainable energy system?

# OCEAN BATTERY
At Ocean Grazer we transformed pumped hydro storage technology into a storage solution
that is embedded into the seabed with identical functionality and performance. With one big
difference the hydrostatic pressure comes for free, we don’t need to build an entire hydro dam.
A. Rigid Reservoir
Concrete reservoirs buried in the seabed
with a volume of 20.000 m3, where the
water is stored under low pressure when
the system is discharged.

The Ocean Battery is a pumped hydro system in a box. Excess power generation can be utilized to store power
in the flexible reservoir. At any point in time, it can be converted back into power in a matter of seconds with
a very high efficiency. Our solution is embedded into the seabed and can be installed in between or next to
existing and new wind farms to enhance the stability, reliability, and profitability of your project. The Ocean
Battery can be perfectly adapted to other forms of renewable power generation such as floating solar, tidal
and wave energy. The storage volume and power capacity for charging and discharging can be adapted to the
specific needs of your project to maximize the value of your investment

Infinite Scalability
Building Blocks
The optimal choice of the storage volume (MWh) and storage capacity (MW)
depends on the specifics of your project and local market conditions. Our
modular design allows to scale the system to your needs and make the optimal
match between system costs and performance characteristics. The Ocean
Battery is constructed based on standardized building blocks and makes it
possible to mix and merge storage volume and capacity. The storage volume
can be sized by connecting the exact amount of rigid reservoir elements, each
with a storage volume of 10 MWh , to create the desired storage volume.
Power capacity ratio
Depending on the power ratio needed additional machine
rooms (with a vertical shaft) can be integrated in the
design such that even the highest capacity demands in
the market with a ratio of 2:1 can be met. Such systems
can be fully charged and discharged in half an hour. On
the other hand it is also possible to lower that ratio to
a ratio of 1:4 and beyond to allow bulk shifting to shift
generation peaks over 4 hours.

More Flexibility
As the pump and turbine capacity are chosen independently from each other
the capacity to charge and discharge the system can be tuned to your specific
business case. Solar power for example is characterized by a huge peak around
noon that requires a high charging capacity for a relatively short period of
the day. Discharging can be done during the rest of the day, which makes it
possible to make the ideal match between project capex and business case to
optimize the NPV of your investment even further.
Pump as a Turbine operation
By reversing the rotational direction of the impellor
of the pumps they can be utilized as a turbine. The
efficiency of the pumps (85%) are significantly lower
than hydro turbines (92%) and most likely will not be
used for normal operations. However when there is
a need for a peak discharging capacity in combined
operation still the penalty in the roundtrip efficiency
of the system is often very acceptable.
Enhance Marine Life
The construction of Ocean Battery systems in wind farms
provides a perfect opportunity to create artificial safe havens
for marine life to rebuild their ecosystems. Fishery and
shipping and other activities by mankind in coastal areas,
especially bottom trawl netting, have destroyed marine
communities at the seabed. In many coastal areas around the
globe people are building artificial reefs, flexible geotextile
structures etc. to achieve this. With the installation of the
Ocean Battery at the seabed these structures come for free
and allow marine life to recover and flourish.
Design with a sustainable planet in mind
Independent of critical metals
To shift away from fossil fuels presents an opportunity. In redesigning the energy system
to mitigate climate change, we have a chance to rethink the way we interact with natural
resources. To effectuate the transition to greener energy we should design systems based on
materials that are abundantly available and make us independent on rare earth materials. The
Ocean Battery is made from steel, concrete, and rubber/PVC. Materials that are available all
over the globe and allow local production of the various components and hence create local
jobs. Ocean Grazer works with local partners that utilize the best-in-class production methods
to minimize GHG-emissions during the production phase, recollect all valuable materials at
the end of life to create a circular economy. All to minimize the environmental impact over the
entire lifetime of our solutions.

The iPhone of the Energy Industry
Paving the way for the energy transition society needs solutions that are readily available today that
do not require any rocket science. Rapid scale up is crucial to meet the timelines and sustainability
goals. This can only be done if all the components are available today. The Ocean Battery is based on
hydro dam technology that has proven itself over more than a century and is abundantly available.
Pumped hydro storage, it is the cheapest and most widespread utility scale energy storage solution
today with a market share of more than 90%.
Smart integration of existing technologies
Hydro Turbines
Immersed Tunnels
Egyptians already utilized water
wheels in 250 BC. The first modern
water turbine has been designed in
the early 19th century.
Water tunnels orginate from 5th century BC. The first
immerged tunnels were constructed in the US in 1957 in
Baltimore and Hampton and are still fully operational.

Flexible Bladder
Diving Bell Access
Water Pumps
The first water pumps date from
the Greek and Roman cultures.
The Dutch used water pumps at an
industrial scale back in the 13th
century to drainage cities.
Flexible storage tanks have been in use
1970s to transport large volumes of water
and fuels over sea.
The first diving bells originate from 4th century BC and
described by Aristotle. The design of diving bells has been
continuously improved over time. Spalding’s diving bell
design originates from 19th century.
The hydrostatic pressure at the seabed is available for free and does not require the costly
construction of a hydro dam. Hence our solution does look completely different but is still based
on the same principles and underlying technologies. Moreover, offshore conditions require
different materials, installation, and construction methods. The result is a solution based on a
smart integration of the best of breed technologies from a broad range disciplines into a scalable,
reliable and affordable storage system that can be installed in almost any water around the globe
independent if it is inshore or offshore.

Prevent Curtailment
The Ocean Battery provides large scale energy storage installed at the
source of power generation and hence can prevent grid curtailment
and/or negative energy prices. Electricity generation no longer needs
to be reduced below the level of what a well-functioning wind turbines
can produce. Under the current market conditions curtailment
represents a significant loss in economic and energy efficiency that
belongs to the past if a wind park is equipped with an Ocean Battery
system.
Congestion Management
With renewable power generation being dispersed over the entire network
excess generation results more and more frequent in network congestion. At
these moments in time the grid capacity becomes insufficient to transport
the generated power from the sources to the load centers. The introduction of
congestion management solutions like local price signals allows grid operators
to reduce the peak load on the power grid. The installation of an large scale
energy storage Ocean Battery system at the source of power generation
allows wind farm operators to adapt their load profile to these price signals to
maximize the value of the power generated.
Utilities need to look beyond matching supply
and demand to maximize the value of your Ocean
Battery storage investment as many other value
drivers for large scale energy storage exist in the
energy market. The adaptability of the Ocean
Battery allows to tune the system requirements
and associated capex to your storage needs. Both
the turbine and pump capacity can be configured
independently and can meet the highest power
demands in the market. The modular design
allows to scale up to virtually any storage volume
a utility or wind farm owner needs to maximize
the NPV.

Overplanting
Currently offshore wind farms are scaled to the available network
capacity to ensure that grid curtailment is minimized, and the
profitability of the wind farm is maximized. A large-scale energy storage
Ocean Battery facility allows overplanting to maximize the energy yield
per square kilometer. In other words it allows to install more turbine
capacity at the same project and hence significantly improving the
economics of the project.
Overplanting becomes even more attractive halfway the 40 years of
exploitations rights of an offshore wind lot. It is expected that wind
farms will be updated midway to capitalize on larger turbines to
generate more power whereas the grid connection is expected to last for
at least 40 years without significant works.

Forecast Errors
Weather models fail to accurately
predict the timing of the wind force.
Large scale energy storage solutions
with a fast response and allow
frequent charging and discharging
without aging quickly, like the Ocean
Battery, transform wind farms into
dispatchable power plants with
a controllable output power. The
Ocean Battery prevents that the
wind farm gets exposed to the large
price fluctuations on the imbalance
markets. Moreover, the Ocean
Battery averts grid instabilities and
blackouts.
Energy Arbitrage Markets
During the transition towards a
sustainable energy system more
and more renewable power from
intermittent energy sources is feed
into the power system. This results
in an increased prices spread with
a rapidly increasing number of
hours annually where energy prices
become negative. The Ocean Battery
prevents wind farm operators selling
renewable energy at negative energy
prices that without large scale
energy storage would adversely
impact their business case.
Ancillary Services – Black start Power
Offshore wind farms are installed far from the load centers and replace conventional generation
that traditionally play a key role during the grid restoration process after a black out. The output
power of wind turbines is based on power electronics pose a risk to the power system dynamic
stability. The above factors along with stronger linking of national power systems can result in
cascaded tripping of generation and potentially trigger wide-area blackouts. The Ocean Battery
can in analogy of hydroelectric generation stations provide the crucial black start power to restart
(the offshore) power grid and cancel out the necessity of costly offshore-substation diesel-
generator backup-power for supplying the auxiliaries.
Ancillary Services – Frequency Control
Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) are crucial for the system
operator to ensure the short-term supply and demand balancing throughout
the entire power system. Depending on the jurisdiction these services are
frequently operated utilizing an FCAS market. The Ocean Battery can rapidly
respond to these market signals and inject or reduce energy without any
limitations on the number of cycles that the system needs to provide to
stabilize the grid. Hence it is an ideal tool for grid stabilization. This provides
a very attractive revenue stream for the storage owners/operators.
After years of development at the water
lab of the University of Groningen,
beginning 2021 the time was ready
to validate the system performance
of the Ocean Battery under realistic
conditions. To that end a prototype of
the Ocean Battery has been deployed
at Groningen Sea Ports. The test
results demonstrated that our models
accurately predict the performance
of the Ocean Battery and moreover
that the system meets the highest
performance expectations. Hence a
green light for scaling up the system
towards utility scale and integrate
it with large scale renewable power
generation.
